You will need to get your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie to use this tool (if you have signed in to Roblox studio on Windows, we will automatically detect the account). You will also need to disable the parent pin. It may take a while because there is an intentional delay between requests.

Running the tool:
- `git clone https://github.com/Wolftallemo/roblox-follower-purge.git`
- `npm install`
- `npx tsc`
- `node dist`
